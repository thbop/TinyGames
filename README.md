## Specifically Tiny Flappy Bird

![Cool alt text](/a.gif)

Based off of MattKC's video about [fitting a game inside of a QR code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExwqNreocpg) and javidx9's video about [writing tetris in the command prompt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OK8_tHeCIA), I wrote a flappy bird clone purely in C. The executable weighs in at 1068 bytes.

## Build Instructions
Install the C++ desktop build tools from the [Build Tools for Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022), download/extract the latest [Crinkler release](https://github.com/runestubbe/Crinkler/releases) (this project used v2.3), run the Developer Command Prompt, and compile using the included batch file.
